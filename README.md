This is the online companion to the publication

> O. Yurdakul, F. Qiu, and A. Meyer "A Predictive Prescription Framework for Unit Commitment Using Boosting Ensemble Learning Algorithms," 
> submitted to IEEE Transactions on Power Systems.

This online companion contains
1. [Appendix A](/appendixA.pdf), wherein we furnish the notation and the mathematical formulation of the unit commitment problem employed in the publication
2. [Appendix B](), wherein we report the results of two additional case studies conduct to further assess the performance of the proposed framework
3. [source code]() of the case studies
4. further details on the case study results reported in the publication
